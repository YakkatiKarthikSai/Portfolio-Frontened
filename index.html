                    <h4>Photography</h4>
                    <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light, either
                        electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material
                        such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g.,
                        photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video
                        production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.[1] A person who makes
                        photographs is called a photographer.</p>
                    <p>Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image
                        on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image
                        sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and
                        stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with
                        photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a
                        visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic
                        material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to
                        photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an
                        enlarger or by contact printing.</p>

                    <h4>Volley Ball</h4>
                    <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team
                        tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It
                        has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach
                        volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted
                        version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.

                        The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on
                        one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting
                        it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into
                        the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their
                        court. The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the
                        court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the
                        first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball
                        back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and
                        continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and
                        serves the ball to start the next rally.</p>
